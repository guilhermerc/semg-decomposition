## Progress tracking

The following algorithm is described on Negro et al. (J. Neural Engineering,
2015) - page 3:

- [x] 1. Subtract the mean from the observations x
- [ ] 2. Whiten x
- [ ] 3. Initialize the matrix B to empty matrix
- [ ] 4. For i = 1, 2, ..., M repeat:
  - [ ] 4.1 Initialize the vector w\_i(0) and w\_i(-1)
  - [ ] (...)
