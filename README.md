#### Progress tracking

The following algorithm is described on Negro et al. (J. Neural Engineering,
2015) - page 3:

- [x] Extend the observations x by a R factor
- [x] Subtract the mean from the observations x
- [x] Whiten x
- [ ] Initialize the matrix B to empty matrix
- [ ] For i = 1, 2, ..., M repeat:
  - [ ] 1. Initialize the vector w\_i(0) and w\_i(-1)
